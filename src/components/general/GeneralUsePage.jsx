Welcome to the American Diner (UK), where we embrace American culture with a British twist and a side of sarcasm. These terms and conditions are as binding as a feathered hat in a hurricane, so please read them with a pinch of salt – or should we say, a dash of vinegar?

<h3>1. Reservation of Absurdity</h3>

By entering our website, you agree to embark on a journey of culinary confusion and comedic chaos.
We reserve the right to replace American apple pie with British crumpets on our menu, just to keep you on your toes.

<h3>2. Orders and Tea Time</h3>

We strive to deliver your food faster than Big Ben's hourly chime, but sometimes our chef takes a tea break.
Please expect our delivery drivers to occasionally quote Shakespeare during deliveries for that extra British touch.
<h3>3. Fish and Fables</h3>

We cannot guarantee that your fish and chips will grant you a British knighthood.
<h3>4. Surprise Ingredient Saturdays</h3>

On Saturdays, our "Surprise Ingredient Special" may actually be a surprise. It could be cricket flour, it could be fairy dust, who knows?
<h3>5. Allergic Reactions</h3>

We are not responsible for allergic reactions caused by mistaking "Marmite" for "Delight." Consult a local Brit for clarification.
<h3>6. Tea-Stealing Poltergeists</h3>

If your tea mysteriously disappears, it's not our fault. Blame it on the mischievous tea-stealing poltergeists.
<h3>7. Proper English Etiquette</h3>

You may occasionally experience episodes of using words like "bloke," "cheeky," or "cuppa" while dining with us. Don't be alarmed; it's just our British spirit taking over.
<h3>8. Unconventional Pop Culture References</h3>

Our menu descriptions may contain witty references to the Royal Family, Doctor Who, or Harry Potter. Don't be surprised if your burger arrives with a tiny crown.
<h3>9. Biscuit vs. Cookie Debate</h3>

We don't take sides in the great biscuit vs. cookie debate, but we do offer friendly debates on the subject every Tuesday afternoon.
<h3>10. Intellectual Property</h3>
- Our fictitious dishes, like the "Queen's Corgi Crunchwrap," are shielded by imaginary double-decker bus copyrights. Any unauthorized duplication will result in us offering you a spot of tea.

<h3>11. Legal Tea Break</h3>
- These terms are as legally binding as trying to solve the mystery of the Loch Ness Monster with a magnifying glass.

<h3>12. Contact Us</h3>
- If you have any questions, require assistance with a crossword puzzle, or simply want to discuss the weather, please contact us. Our butler will respond promptly or when he finishes serving high tea.

By continuing to explore our website, you hereby confirm that you're ready to embrace the comically confusing world of the American Diner (UK). Bon appétit, or rather, jolly good show!
